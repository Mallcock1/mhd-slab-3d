# mhd-slab-3d
3D visualisations of MHD waves in asymmetric and symmetric slabs

Prerequisites:
Python 2 (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/),
Mayavi (http://mayavi.sourceforge.net/).

Builds an animation of the magnetoacoustic eigenmodes of an isolated asymmetric magnetic slab with possible visualisations of:
magnetic field lines,
magentic field strength,
mgnetic field vectors,
velocity (eularian and lagrangian),
displacement,
density (eularian and lagrangian),
slab boundary perturbations.

We use the analytical solutions given in our paper: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-017-1054-y
